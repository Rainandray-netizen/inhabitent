# Inhabitent

Inhabitent is a mockup of an e-commerce/blog website catering to only the daintiest of outdoorsy hipsters. Please note that no real purchases can be made on this site.

## Installation Instructions

Ensure you have wordpress installed.  Replace the wp-content folder with the contents of this git repository.  Log in as wp-admin and change the theme to Inhabitent if necessary.

## Technology Used

In this project I used HTML, CSS, PHP, and Wordpress.

### What I learned

This site was my first real wordpress project and it really threw me for a loop. Building a full scale website was not something I felt prepared for going into this project. Coming out of it, I only feel marginally better. I do feel as though I have a much stronger grasp of wordpress than I had before, so thats a small win.
